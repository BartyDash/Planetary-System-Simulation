# Planetary System Simulation 🪐🚀

Welcome to the **Planetary System Simulation** project! This web application allows you to simulate the trajectories of two planets in a gravitational system.

## Features

🌌 **Simulation Form**: Enter the masses, initial positions, and velocities of two planets.  
📈 **Trajectory Prediction**: Calculate the predicted trajectories based on your input.  
🎥 **Live Simulation**: View the trajectories interactively with Plotly.

## Technologies Used

🖥️ **Python**: Backend powered by Flask.  
🔢 **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array handling.  
📊 **Plotly**: To create interactive visualizations of the trajectories.  
🌐 **HTML/CSS**: For the frontend user interface.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. 🚀 Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. 📦 Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. 🖥️ Start the Flask application: `python app.py`
4. 🌐 Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## How to Use

1. 📝 Enter the masses, initial positions, and velocities of the two planets in the provided form.
2. 🔮 Click "Predict Trajectory" to simulate and visualize the paths of the planets.
3. 🌠 Use the interactive plot to observe the planetary movements.
4. 🎬 Optionally, click "Show Live Simulation" for a dynamic visualization of the trajectories.
